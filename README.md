# Quick-Refs

A collection of quick references for command line client (CLI) tools such as **git** and **docker**.

While I'll be using one or more of these CLIs at any given time, it seems that I don't use them often enough or there's too much
time in between for me to remember all the little details. So I started to collect all the commands I need(ed) here, sometimes
artificially expanded the list with those command I think might come in handy some day. That way, I don't have to keep a bunch
of online documentations open in the browser all the time. An added benefit is that it is possible to look at the references
offline and so use any CLI tool offline (where possible).
I don't claim completeness or up-to-date correct syntax, as many of those CLIs or their respective tools evolve. If something 
isn't working or you are in doubt about the correctness of a command please refer to the respective official online 
documentation.

Feel free to clone/fork and then use and expand this project as you wish.
